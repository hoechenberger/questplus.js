# questplus.js â€“ a QUEST+ implementation in TypeScript

Very much WIP, do not use yet.

## Development installation

```shell
npm i
```

## Running the demo module

```shell
node src/demo.mjs
```

## Building a JavaScript NPM package

```shell
npm run build
npm pack
```

This will create an archive `questplus-x.y.z.tgz`, which you may
install via `npm` into another project:

```shell
npm i /Development/questplus.js/questplus-x.y.z.tgz
```
